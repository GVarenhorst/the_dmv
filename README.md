# Q1-- Digging into code base. What was your process?

Q1 Answer-- First I examined the lib files individually, side by side with it's respective spec file. Without touching the lib file code, I examined what the tests required, and wrote down on paper what I thought would need to be added or changed. Close file, rinse and repeat with the next file, until I had a working tree for reference of each file before actually testing. Then I run the test files and compare with my answers.

# Q2 -- What was hard about working with pre-written code? 

Q2 Answer-- I didn't see anything particularly hard about the process. It was about orienting myself within the work, more than anything else.

# Q3 -- What was easier than expected about jumping into an unfamiliar codebase and what made it easy?

Q3 Answer-- Having a backbone of code presented makes it easier to see the structure of how these codefiles work together.
